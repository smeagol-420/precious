## Chapter 1 – The Myth of Easy Collaboration

You’ve done it.  
Finally.  
Your research is complete, and you're ready to share your discoveries with the world.

The days of floppy disks are long gone. You embrace modern tools: Jupyter Notebooks, web services, containerized environments. You know what packages are needed. You’ve tested everything. Reproducibility is at hand.

You want to show the world how you created such wisdom with your bare hands.  
And so your journey begins...


## Chapter 2 – The First Hurdle
Your university (or institute—or whoever funds your potions and scrolls) has its own JupyterHub.  
You register. You wait. You win the first battle and gain access.

You upload your code. You run it.

It fails.

Missing packages. Broken environments.  
Your work turns to ash before your eyes.

After another long battle, you build your own kernel. A custom environment. Finally, it works—for you.

Hope returns.

## Chapter 3 – The Vault

You are confident now. Your code runs. Your results are sound.  
Time to share your work with others.

You send out the link to your institution's JupyterHub.

But all the ravens return with the same reply:  
> **Access Denied. 403. No account available.**

So **you** are able to run your code in a "public" place - but other's are not.

But it is no open field. It is a **vault**, sealed behind login walls, mysterious configs, and forgotten credentials.

You begin to understand:  
**Sharing is caring—but sharing’s not easy.**

## Chapter 4 – The Temptation of Binder

Then, from the web itself, a new ally emerges: **Binder**.

With one click, it breathes life into your notebook, spinning up the same environment from nothing.

It feels like magic. Like power.

But as you close the browser tab, reality sets in.  
Your changes are gone. The magic fades.  

No persistence. No data storage.  
What good is a spell if it cannot be recalled?

You need something more.

## Chapter 5 – The Gates of Jupyter4NFDI

Beyond the mists of stateless sessions lies **Jupyter4NFDI**.

Here, Binder’s magic is reborn with **persistence**.

You mount external storage:  
- B2DROP opens like an elvish archive.  
- AWS and S3 buckets yield their secrets.  

## Chapter 6 – The Link of Power

You now hold a treasure greater than any golden ring:  
a **Share Link**.

One link to recreate your notebook, your mounts, your environment—all of it.

You place it in your paper, on your project page, in the scrolls of publication.

> “Reproduce this. Expand it. Build upon it.”

Everyone may follow—but no secrets leak.

Credentials remain veiled. Tokens are protected.  
Wanderers may relive your code, but never steal from it.

And at the gate stands **Helmholtz ID**.  
A guardian offering secure, GDPR-compliant access to scholars across Europe and beyond.

No matter their land or lineage—**they are welcomed**.

The barriers are gone.  
The fellowship grows.

## Epilogue – The End of the Old Ways

The burden of configuration, the torment of incompatibility—  
has been **cast into the fires of Mount Doom**.

What once took hours now takes minutes.  
What was once lost is now reproducible.

A new age dawns:  
- Of persistence  
- Of portability  
- Of open, federated collaboration

Across Germany and beyond, Researchers stand united.

This is the rise of **Jupyter4NFDI**.  
Not one single tool, but many—bound together.

> A fellowship not of rings, but of researchers.

And though this story ends...
